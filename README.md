DISCLAIMER
With this code, it's possible to bypass the checks of some websites that prevent web scraping or crawling programs from interacting with login-required websites.
This code is for informational purposes only, as web scraping may violate the terms of service of the website from which you are attempting to retrieve information.

SUGGESTION
It is recommended to implement an active change of UserAgent parameters, and change the UserAgent String every few uses, as automated activities coming from the same UserAgent may raise some red flags and result in an account ban.
It is also advisable, once you're logged-in, to implement random waits and clicks in the code to simulate human interaction as much as possible and thus avoid being banned.
